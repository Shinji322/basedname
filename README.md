# basedname

This is a more based version of the standard unix tool `basename`. It is intended to simply be a reimplementation of it with some extra flags for fun.


# Roadmap

* [ ] Add flags from original `basename` so it can be used as a drop in replacement
* [ ] Rename `cli::Args::arg_parse()` to `cli::Args::parse()`
